Change Control

Why

1) Want access to all my scripts/code on any machine
2) Want latest updates available to multiple machines
3) Want to be able to update code without fear of not being able to roll back changes


1) Build a repository - where I am going to keep code I want to share
2) Update code - push update to local repository - push to "cloud" respository
3) Pull down code to different location\different machine
4) Make changes and roll back to prior change (99% of the time, go to last checkin)

Create a Repository - Using Windows Tools from GitHub.com - Initially - do not push to GitHub.com
Create file(s) in repo that you want to track (Demonstrate-ChangeControl.ps1 and demofile.txt)
Use Add-GitFile function 

md demo
cd demo
"foo" > foo.txt
"bar" > bar.txt
# initialize the repository
git init
notice prompt "current branch" | # files that have been edited since commit | 
git add *
git commit *
git tag -a V1.0
git log --decorate --oneline
git branch BasedOnV.1Tag v1.0
